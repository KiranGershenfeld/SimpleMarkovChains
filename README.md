# SimpleMarkovChains
This project uses markovs chains to immitate any set of text that it is given

Markov Chains are a type of algorithm that examines each word of a text file and the probability of the words that come after it. Doing this for every word, it is able to predict which words will come after each other and create entirely new strings of text. 

In this project there are several implementations of Markov Chains. The first file generates the text one word at a time while the following files use different sized strings of words to create more coherent strings of text.
